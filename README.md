4 Project

CSC173: Project 1 
**Finite Automata**

Finite automata are simple computing “devices” that recognize patterns, as seen in class
and in the textbook.
For this project, you must implement a framework that you (or any programmer) can use
to define and execute automata in order to recognize patterns. The framework comes
directly from the formal model of automata.
Using your framework, you should be able to define and execute any finite automaton
for any pattern that can be recognized by a finite automaton.
Note: The project is not about writing programs that recognize specific patterns. Yes,
you will use your framework in a program that creates and executes a number of different
automata (details below). But the specific patterns are not the point of the project. In
fact, I recommend that you not even think about the specific patterns as you design and
implement the framework.


CSC173: Project 2
**Recursive Descent and Table-Driven Parsing**

The goal of this project is to demonstrate your understanding of the formal model of
context-free grammars and parsing by applying the principles of the model to a specific
grammar (details below).
The goal of the project is not simply for you to write a program that parses strings from
the specific required grammar. The goal is for you to demonstrate how the formal model
allows you build a parser based on the grammar mechanically with almost no thinking
required.


CSC173: Project 3
**Functional Programming**

In this unit, we are looking at Alan Turing’s formalization of “computable functions” using
Turing machines. I have posted Turing’s famous paper On Computable Numbers (Turing,
1937a) on BlackBoard for you




CSC173: Project 4
**The Relational Data Model**

In this project you will gain experience with databases and relational algebra by imple-
menting your own database system. We will build on the presentation (and code) in the
textbook. You must follow the formal model, even though your database will be very
small. If you do it properly, it would also work for a large database.
