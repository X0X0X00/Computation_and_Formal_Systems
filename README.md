# CSC173 Computation and Formal Systems

This course is an introduction to some of the most important formal models of computa‚Äê
tion, and their application to real-world computing problems. We learn the formal models,
we learn the techniques for analyzing and understanding formal models, we implement
something related to the formal models, and we learn how theory and practice go hand in
hand in Computer Science.
