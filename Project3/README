CSC173
Project 3
Zhenhao Zhang zzh133@u.rochester.edu

I finished the entire project by myself and used the code and method from the instructions. 
There are three different sections and four functions for each section. I use the idea declaratively 
("say what something is, not how to compute it") to write the code using regression.

To run the code correctly, you need to open the current directory using the command cd /Users/zzh/Visual\ Studio\ 
Code/CSC\ 173\ Project\ 3 (which is correct on my Mac). Then run abcl using the command java -jar java -jar 
/Users/zzh/Visual\ Studio\ Code/CSC\ 173\ Project\ 3/abcl-bin-1.9.2/abcl.jar. Then load project 3 using 
the command (load "project3"). Finally, you can test my project 3 using the code in the instructions.
